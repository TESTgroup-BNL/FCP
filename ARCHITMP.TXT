Since we have lost several investigators who have held their breadth
waiting for the "archive" option of the COM program to be completed,
I am sending a description of using the "simulation" option as
a temporary solution for looking at line graphs.

The first step where you set up the data files in a subdirectory
called \X, for example, is not necessary; it just further protects
the original LOGG and PARR files.  Steps (c) & (d) highly recommended.

1) New subdirectory

   a) Make \X
   b) Copy/v over the desired LOGGx.DAT files as LOGGxS.DAT.  (See the S?)
   c) Copy/v over the desired PARRx.SET files as PARRxS.SET.  (Optional)
   d) Copy/v over the desired DISPx.SET files as DISPxS.SET.  (Optional)
   e) Copy/v over the .CFG file as e.g. LOOKAT.CFG
   f) In LOOKAT.CFG change the data logging path from ~D\ to ~X\
   g) In LOOKAT.CFG disable serial ports, i.e. set to -1.  (Optional)

2) Starting program

   LOOKAT.BAT = C:                  [or whatever drives and subdirs]
                CD \FACEPROG\COM
                COM98BP simulation \X\LOOKAT.CFG  [never made it case insen.]

3) Changing the PARR file(s) -- done only once

   a) <F3> Algorithm
      Turn fumigation OFF for all rings.  This should kill all alarms.
      If already OFF, use space bar to toggle around to OFF again anyway!

   b) <F4> Data logging
      Place cursor on LOGG file.
      Hit Right-Arrow to open the <Open/Close> window.
      Hit "C" to close the file.
      Repeat for VARR file, STAT file if necessary.
      Leave PARR file open!
      Repeat for other rings if necessary.

4) DISP files (graphic display parameters)

   Unless you copied over the DISP files you had been using, program
   will show graphs using default parameters.  From <F5> Line graph
   screen, put cursor on a file type and then hit <F2>.  You can
   then chose which variables to graph, colors, location, and scale
   for what you are trying to accomplish.

5) <F5> Line graphs <F6> Historic

   This is the only useful option.  After putting up a screen, the
   Up-Arrow and Down-Arrow keys can be used to move through the
   data.  The A-key toggles the display of screen averages in the
   numeric text window rather than point values (numbers are white
   when they represent averages).

   Don't forget that the "performance percentages" and screen averages
   are calculated only for the records that are in the line graph
   display buffer.  This is not every record actually in the time 
   interval unless the interval is only three hours.

   Also the COM program is non-judgemental.  It calculates percentages
   and averages regardless of whether fumigation is on or off
   (important for e.g. gas use but not e.g. wind speed), whether data
   includes error flags, etc.  COM is no replacement for a good
   data analysis program, starting with LOGG2DB for example, which
   makes use of the status bits.

6) Communication ports

   When you start LOOKAT.CFG in a DOS window under Windows 95 or NT,
   you may get one or two popup windows complaining about nonexistence
   or conflicts with serial ports.  Just click (Ignore) and get back
   to your DOS window.  Or, you can set all serial ports in LOOKAT.CFG
   to -1.
