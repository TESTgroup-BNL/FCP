-------------------- AMBIENT MULTIPORT FILE HELP ----------------------
2004-12-02  J.N.

An imbedded ambient multiport is declared using an optional "800" line 
  after line 16 of the FCP configuration (CFG) file.  The only argument
  on this line is the [path]filename of a hardware configuration / node
  definition (DEF) file.

The filename NONE is equivalent to having no 800 line at all, i.e. the 
  program will not use an imbedded ambient/control gas concentration 
  multiport.

Sample lines:
800  NONE                           AMBIENT MULTIPORT DEFINITION FILE
800  F99NC1-6.DEF                   AMBIENT MULTIPORT DEFINITION FILE
800  E:\FACEPROG\COM\TEST.DEF       AMBIENT MULTIPORT DEFINITION FILE

An explicit control or ambient [gas] measurement (see facility .CFG)
  takes precedence.

NOTE!!  If the ambient multiport uses the same communications port
  as that for ring data acquisition and control, the port parameters
  DEFINED HERE HAVE PRECEDENCE simply because they are read second
  and overwrite any prior settings.

If an imbedded multiport is being defined, its configuration file has 
  the following format:

  LINE FIELD CONTENTS
    1    1    1           The number "1" without quotes
    1    2    Port        COMn serial port e.g. "4"
    1    3    Address     I/O address of port (ignored WinNT+)

    1    8    Parity      "N"
    1    9    Protocol    The string "DS"

    2    1    2           The number "2" -- Gas concentration
    2    2    Address     Network address
    2    3    Channel     See description of analog input in CFG.TXT
    2    4    Range       See description of analog input in CFG.TXT
    2    5    Gain        Engineering units per volt
    2    6    Offset      In engineering units
    2    7    Offscale    Error return value
    2    8    "unit"
    2    9    "name"

    3    1    3           The number "3" -- Sample flow meter
      Same variables as previous line.

    4    1    4           The number "4" -- Good bit input
    4    2    Address     Network address
    4    3    Channel     See description of digital input in CFG.TXT
    4    4    Invert?     Set to "1" to invert input; "0" is normal
                          (Possibly inverted) input logical 1 is good

    5    1    5           The number "5"
    5    2    Address     Solenoid/valve board network address
    5    3    N           Total number of nodes (sampling points)

    6x   1    I           Intake channel number
    7x                      Normally 0..15
    etc.                    -1: Skip code -- see below
    6x   2    TP          Purge time in seconds, e.g. 55
    6x   3    TS          Sample time in seconds, e.g. 5
    6x   4    MIN_FLOW    Miniumum flow requirement
    6x   5    TIMEOUT     Seconds since last good measurement before
                          that value is flagged "stale"  

SPECIAL CHANNEL CODES

-1  This entry is skipped (ignored but still counts in Line 5 N value)

Line 6x is repeated N-1 more times for each node.
Program stops on too few lines.
No warning given on too many lines.
Nodes are sampled in the order given in this file. <-----------
