FCP HISTORY  substantive or user related changes only
-----------


--- 7.04  2009-11-19


(1) DataComm/Refresh: fix left panel controls visibility problem
(2) MPSample/ambient_mp_init: prevent spurious 0x00 power_up_clear


--- 7.03  2009-11-13


(1) Ring and embedded multiport data channels can now be IP
Socket.pas -- Function unit added
DataComm.pas .dfm -- Extensive changes to support IP
Old .cfg files are still good
Mostly a test of the DataComm and Socket code
Have tested with TCP/UDP, wired/wireless, LiCor 6262/840


--- 7.02  2009-10-07


(1) DataComm and Optomux units:
For serial interfaces, Optomux now reads a terminated string
through DataComm.  Previously, Optomux looped over single
character reads.  To parallel IP reads, which will be done
as whole packets.


--- 7.01  2009-08-17


(1) Replace comm_dp4 and daqcrec by Serial and DataComm.Ports[].
First step towards upgrading data communications options to
include IP.  Units changed are COMD, LICOR, Watchdog, MPSample,
GLOBALS, Main, COMS, COMP, OPTOMUX, DataComm.


--- 7.00  2009-07-30


(1) FCP.dpr only
Change version number to 7.00.  Otherwise identical to version 6.77.
This will be the starting point for program changes for the next
generation of FACE experiments.


--- 6.77  2009-01-22


(1) Watchdog
OnClickButton: Impose 20s floor and granularity on Timeout.txt
Pet/ffpwcnt:   Fix bug by replacing lobyte:= by value:=

(1) TEI in comp/analog_in
Add line error := error OR (volts >= offscale);
This will force setting comm_err[] which should prevent error
flags from getting into integrals.  May have bad side effects.


--- 6.76  2007-06-15


(1) COMP: Change WI [O3] PEAK target from 100 to 120 ppb
(2) RIV: Implement <Help> as LblForm and update
(3) Main: Don't call old_consoles if statscr is already true
(4) COMS: Don't integrate agcont, agc1m, agc5m, gc_mp3s[] if comm_err[]
(5) Alarms: ShowHint true; write Hint for enclosure temperature limit


--- 6.75  2007-05-31


(1) TEI49C: Protect against checksums in 49I responses


--- 6.74  2007-03-13


(1) VVP TESTING DID NOT APPLY TO NC1 ONLY
(2) ADDED MARCH 2007 ONLY AS WELL
(3) DEFAULT IS NOW 8 VVP OPEN


--- 6.73  2007-02-28


(1) SIMULATION MODE VALUES OF WIND DIRECTION

Easier checking of VVP pattern related code changes

(2) OAK RIDGE VAPORIZER CYCLING

Applies only to site TN1.  If in proportional valve
alarm and grab valve read back value is less than
90% of valve set to value, then CInteg is changed to
5% of offscale.

(3) VVP PATTERN TESTING

Applies only to site NC1.  On odd days-of-year Ring 2
is set to 8-valve open pattern.  On even days-of-year
Ring 4 is.  Wind down pattern not affected.



--- 6.72  2006-09-24


(1) CHANGING ENCLOSURE TEMPERATURE ALARM SET POINT

See Alarms > ? Help

Each ring (actually replicate) has a separate set point.

Applies to either enclosure or auxiliary temperature.
(AZ2 and WI1 only)

Change dialog boxes are modal.  Sampling, control, etc.
are suspended so make a change quickly.

Change is not saved to disk.  Default values will be
reinstated if program is restarted.  If you switch
"enclosure temperature" among shed air temperature,
electronics box temperature, gas analyzer cell temperature,
compressor head temperature, etc., request a change
in your site specific default values.

(1) WINDOW'S APPLICATION EVENT LOG

When starting or stopping normally, FCP now writes to
Window's Application Event Log, which includes date/time.

To view events,
Start > Control panel > Administrative tools > Event log
Select Application in left panel.

On menu bar, see Help > Help topics > Event viewer
for things to do with a log, including filters, saving as.

EventSource: FCP

EventID:  50000  Starting program
          50001  File information (.exe, .cfg, .def)
          50002  Shutting down
          50003  Shutdown aborted
          50004  Stopping (program exit)
          50005  FatalErr calls

Normally a 50000 is preceded by a 50004.
But if the program ended abnormally or the OS
crashed, there will be no 50004.

The normal sequence is 50000 50001 50002 50004
when staged shutdown is used to stop FCP.

The 50002 will be missing if immediate program
exit was requested.

There are many reasons why the FatalErr procedure
may be called during program startup.  The
sequence may be 50000 50005 50004 e.g. CFG file not found
or 50000 50001 50005 50004 e.g. a SET file missing.

Double click, or right click, on an event line to
see event properties.  Scroll through events using the
up and down arrow controls on the form (not the keyboard).

The verbiage in "Description" is meaningless.  I refuse
to do what Microsoft expects to be done here, as you can
probably guess by reading it.

I put additional information about the event in the "Data"
section.  This has a vertical scroll bar.
