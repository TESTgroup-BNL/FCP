# FCP
## FACE Control Program

Built using Delphi 6.  (Compatibility with Delphi 10.4 is possible, but would require refactoring largely the way strings are handled.)

To build, run MAKEFCP.bat.

To run, run "FCP.<version>.exe <config file>", where <version> is the FCP version number and <config file> is a valid FCP config file.

To simulate without hardware, run sim.bat or "FCP.<version>.exe simulation <sim config file>".  Simulation config file is "sim.txt" by default.
